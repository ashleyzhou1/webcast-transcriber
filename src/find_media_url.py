find_media_url.py

Automates the manual DevTools process we used all week to find downloadable
audio/video URLs on webcast player pages:
  1. Open the page in a real browser (Playwright)
  2. Capture all network requests as the page loads and plays
  3. Look for either:
     a) A direct media file requested with status 206 (range request),
        same filename repeated multiple times -> e.g. Oracle, Meta, Cisco,
        Qualcomm, IBM (Q4 Inc / ChorusCall-hosted direct mp4s)
     b) A .m3u8 HLS manifest URL -> e.g. SanDisk, Broadcom, ASML, TSMC,
        Alibaba (media-server.com / CloudFront / hinet.net HLS streams)
  4. Return the best candidate URL(s) found, ready to hand off to
     download.py (for direct files) or ffmpeg (for .m3u8 streams)

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS / LIMITATIONS (be upfront about these in findings):
  - Assumes the browser session is ALREADY LOGGED IN via a saved session
    file created with save_login_session.py. This script does not handle
    login forms, 2FA, or registration walls itself.
  - Does not guarantee success on signed/session-bound URLs (e.g. Nvidia's
    Veracast setup) -- those require an active authenticated session at
    the URL level, not just the page level, and will likely fail even if
    a candidate URL is found.
  - When multiple .m3u8 files are found (e.g. TSMC's "playlist" vs
    "chunklist"), this script prefers the one with "playlist" in the name,
    matching what we found works best manually.
  - Does NOT auto-click play -- in --debug mode it pauses for you to click
    play manually, since player UIs vary too much to reliably automate
    that click. Without --debug (headless), it will likely find nothing
    unless the page autoplays.
  - This is a best-effort heuristic based on patterns observed across ~15
    companies this week. It will not work on every platform.

Requires: playwright (pip install playwright && playwright install chromium)

Usage (standalone):
    python find_media_url.py <webcast_page_url> [storage_state.json] [--debug]

    If storage_state.json is omitted, the script tries to auto-detect the
    right saved session based on the URL's domain (see PLATFORM_SESSIONS
    below).

Usage (as a module):
    from find_media_url import find_media_url
    result = find_media_url("https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/529869698", storage_state_path="q4inc_session.json")
